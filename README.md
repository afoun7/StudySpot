# StudySpot
Project for CS220: Human Computer Interaction

StudySpot is a semi-functional prototype, with the front-end fully implemented, of an iPhone app created with two other team members. Our motivation behind creating this app stemmed from the issue of the crowding of certain study spaces and lack of knowledge about others on our college campus. Thus, we designed an app that generates locations to study based off of oneâ€™s mood, amount of work, type of work, and proximity to where you are currently located.
